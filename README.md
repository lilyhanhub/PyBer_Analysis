# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
PyBer is python-based ride-sharing app company. The goal of this analysis is two-fold: first, analyzing the ride-sharing data from January to April 2019 to create a summary DataFrame with the following metrics: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per drive. All are categorized by city types; second, creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type by using Pandas and Matplotlib. The analysis will summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by PyBer decision-makers. 

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

![multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type](/analysis/Fig8.png)
The multiple-line chart shows the urban cities had the highest while rural cities had the lowest total fares for each week. The weekly total fare of all city types reaches the first peak at the end of Feburary, then both the urban and rural cities reach the second peak at the beginning of April. In general, all the graphs follow the similar trends throughout the four months, except for the suburban cities, there's a sharp increase from mid to the end of April.


## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
